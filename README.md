#1 The analogy of a puzzle.

Imagine sitting by the table with one thousand puzzle pieces laid out in front of you. Where do you start? What strategy, better or worse, will you apply? Just pick a random piece, any piece. As you are twirling this puzzle element in your fingers in an attempt to find some point of reference, you also begin to feel a brewing neural storm up in your brain chambers. Your senses are narrowing down on this one piece of the puzzle, and you start to notice all kinds of things about it: shape, fuzzy but definite colour, some abstract ripped off paint stroke of a larger image yet to be discovered. This singular tiny piece is dense with information, fragmented and ready to be put in use, offering multitudes of obscure, and yet significant clues. Finally, another piece finds it's corresponding match, followed by a few more affirming their neighbouring positions. There is still nine hundred ninety-six more to go, but you are already feeling like a champ. But have you noticed something?
The significance of the singular piece of the puzzle is starting to melt into multitudes. The starting reference point now grows into a field, and soon enough, you are staring at the sunset on some imaginary island. The final piece of the puzzle also rings the death of all puzzle pieces as they get stripped off significance, heightened attention and excessive handling. Hold that thought for a moment about you forgetting that first piece of a puzzle.

#2 Dalmatian

You are staring at this image and as the title suggests, you are scanning for this dog. It magically lifts off the field of black and white spots. As a piece of a puzzle, emerging whilst detaching from the field of the noise.
